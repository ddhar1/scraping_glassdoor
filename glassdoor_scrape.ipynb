    "I initially starting scraping just glassdoor with just Beautiful Soup and request. I quickly realized I needed to parse the website's javascript using Selenium before scraping the loaded HTML. Unfortunately there wasn't a request JSON file I could find with all the reviews that could easily be taken. I later found out about python's module *scrapy* that\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions I have to answer:\n",
    "* Is format reasonable?\n",
    "* what unit tests should I Implement (aside from checking the page that definitely has reviews has a desired output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Somethings I would do with more time\n",
    "* More abstraction. Particularly because while I've been coding this, glassdoor had already implemented changes in their framework. It's easier to change a command than to change their entire code.\n",
    "* use python module scrapy instead of selenium. Apparently scrapy has better performance due to fact that it loads less features. Apparently a module called scrapy JS exists to load HTML"
